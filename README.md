This allows your Raspberry Pi 4 device to show the clock with an Athan clock so you can stay up to date on the upcoming prayer times

Requirements:

Unicorn HAT Mini https://shop.pimoroni.com/en-us/products/unicorn-hat-mini
Slack to post error messages: https://slack.com/
Set your internal clock in your Raspberry Pi to your local time and update the GPS coordinates in your main.py file to a location close enough for you.

See an example of this: TBD

This displays vertically, i.e. where most of the LEDs are positioned from top to bottom, as this allows the best use of the LEDs offered by the Unicorn HAT Mini.

The Unicorn Hat Mini comes with 4 buttons, all functional with this program.

Press the upper left button once TBD
Press the upper right button once TBD
Press the lower left button once TBD
Press the lower right button once TBD
Known Issues:

When pressing one of the buttons before the drawing of the time or date finishes, the screen will stop at that point. You can remedy this by pressing the button again.
